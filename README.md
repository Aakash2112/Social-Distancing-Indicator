# Social-Distancing-Indicator
The Social Distancing Indicator Project using Arduino was a simple and effective solution to help maintain safe distances in public spaces. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between individuals and triggers audio alerts through LEDs and a buzzer if the distance is less than a predefined threshold.
